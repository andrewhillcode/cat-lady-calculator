# Cat Lady Calculator

Cat Lady Calculator (CLC) is an end of game scoring helper for the [Cat Lady board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/228504/cat-lady).

CLC takes as much thought out of scoring as possible so aside from manually scoring fed cats it's as simple as adding up card/token counts.  

This calculator is based on the [official rule book](https://www.alderac.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cat-lady_rulebook.pdf)
